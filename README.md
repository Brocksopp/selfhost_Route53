# selfhost_Route53

This application is intended to update the IP assignments for specific web domains in Amazon's Route53 service.

To configure the application create a copy of "example_config.json" and rename it to "config.json". Populate the new config file with credentials and domain names.


This can be automated through use of cron/scheduler.
